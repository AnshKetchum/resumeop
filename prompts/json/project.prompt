Now consider the following TypeScript Interface for the JSON schema:

interface ProjectExperience {
    name: string;
    location: string;
    date: string;
    description: string;
}

interface ProjectExperiences {
    projects: ProjectExperience[];
}

Create an array of ProjectExperience section exactly according to the ProjectExperiences schema using the resume. On the response, include only the JSON. Make sure to include every single attribute listed above in each project experience.
