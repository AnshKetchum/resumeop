Now consider the following TypeScript Interface for the JSON schema:

interface TechnicalSkill {
    topic: string;
    name: string[];
}

interface TechnicalSkills {
    skills: TechnicalSkill[];
}

Create an array of TechnicalSkill section according to the TechnicalSkills schema using the latest resume you created. On the response, include only the JSON. Limit the broader topics to 3 at most. Add at least 5 technical skill names, and up to 20 skill names per topic.
