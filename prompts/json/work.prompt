Now consider the following TypeScript Interface for the JSON schema:

interface WorkExperience {
    experience_start: string;
    experience_end: string;
    position: string;
    company: string;
    location: string;
    description: string;
}

interface WorkExperiences {
    works: WorkExperience[];
}

Create an array of WorkExperience section according to the WorkExperiences schema using the resume. On the response, include only the JSON.
